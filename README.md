# EDA-Google-Play-Store
<p>
=>Google Play Store formerly Android Market, is a digital distribution service developed and operated by Google. It is an official app store that provides various content such as apps, books, magazines, music, movies, and television programs. It serves as a platform to allow users with 'Google certified' Android operating system devices to download applications developed and published on the platform either with a charge or free of cost. With the rapid growth of Android devices and apps, it would be interesting to analyze the data to obtain valuable insights.
<br><br>
=>The dataset that is going to be used is 'Google Play Store Apps' from Kaggle. It contains 10k of web-scraped Play Store app data for analyzing the Android market. The tools that are going to be used for this EDA would be numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
<br><br>
=>In This Project  I performed Various Data Preparations and Cleaning Processes. We will be loading the Google Store Apps data stored in CSV using pandas which is a fast and powerful Python library for data analysis and easy data manipulation in pandas DataFrame object. It is usually used for working with tabular data (e.g. data in a spreadsheet) in various formats such as CSV, Excel spreadsheets, HTML tables, JSON, etc. We will then perform some data preparation and also cleaning on it.
